            <h3>Purpose</h3>

            <p>
                The purpose of this web site is to build
                and share useful technology with the people who use my site.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I first started building an online web presence, I began by building <a href="https://www.joecenatiempo.com">joecenatiempo.com</a>,
                my personal website which helped establish my identity to potential clients while running my first software company.
                The scope of that site is strictly to market and sell my ability as a corporate professional.
            </p>

            <p>
                I created JoeCena.com to be different--a functionality-oriented web application whose goal is to
                bring you back again and again for two distinct reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>to use the software or functionality I provide or help spread awareness of</li>
                    <li>to learn more about the implementation of certain kinds of software</li>
                </ul>
                The ultimate goal is to create software and applications so useful that I, myself, become an avid user.<br />
                It also doesn't hurt to hone my writing and editing skills, being fundemental to my ability to perform as a developer and writer.
            </p>

            <p>
                I plan to share tutorials, demos, samples, links, and other content that I tend to write.
            </p>

            <p>
                I conceive of a site where I can provide regular posts which showcase a new piece of functionality
                or provide useful insight into existing pieces of technology. By publishing all of this in a custom web app
                that I myself build from the ground up, I feel I have complete creative control.
            </p>

                    <h3>My Background in git</h3>
                    Over the past few years, I got to travel all around the United States training corporate teams
                    to use git technology in order to write and ship software and content more effectively.
