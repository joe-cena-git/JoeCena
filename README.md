# JoeCena
My blog website, a custom .NET Web Application where I publish things I build or write about.
[https://joecena.com](https://joecena.com)

## Purpose
I want to write and share content around technology and some of my other interests.
By building a web app, I practice skills I use at work, and also feel that I have complete creative control.

## Contributing
You can submit Pull Requests at the GitHub page, and I will review/comment/give feedback directly on the Pull Request.
I welcome your contribution if you're motivated enough to write up something useful.
